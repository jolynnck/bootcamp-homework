## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions:  ls -al /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions:  ls -al /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):  chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions:  ls -al /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):  chmod 644 /etc/group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -al /etc/passwd 

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):  chmod 644 /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): adduser sam (etcetera) OR
        touch newuserinfo.txt
        vim newuserinfo.txt
        i
        sam:Password1!:1014:1014:,,,:/home/sam:/bin/bash
        joe:Password1!:1015:1015:,,,:/home/joe:/bin/bash
        amy:Password1!:1016:1016:,,,:/home/amy:/bin/bash
        sara:Password1!:1017:1017:,,,:/home/sara:/bin/bash
        admin:Password1!:1018:1018:,,,:/home/admin:/bin/bash  [esc]
        :wq
        newusers newuserdetail.txt

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group:  sudo usermod -aG sudo admin
            confirm success with:  grep sudo /etc/group

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group:  addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):  sudo gpasswd -M sam,joe,amy,sara engineers
        confirm success with:  grep engineers /etc/group 

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir /home/engineers    

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers
        confirm success with:  ls -al /home/ | grep engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis:  sudo apt install Lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:  man Lynis

3. Command to run an audit:  sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
